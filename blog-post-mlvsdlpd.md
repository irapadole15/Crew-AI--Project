Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where models learn from structured, labeled data. Think of it like deciding whether to order pizza using three simple inputs: Will it save time, help me lose weight, or save money? Each of these inputs gets a weight based on importance, and the model computes an outcome. If the result is positive, it’s pizza night! ML often relies on human intervention to define features and label datasets - it’s like a person telling the computer what to look for when identifying different foods.

Deep Learning (DL), a further subset of ML, uses deep neural networks with more than three layers. Unlike ML, DL can process raw, unstructured data like images or text without human labeling. Instead of telling the system what pizza looks like, the model figures it out on its own by identifying hidden patterns. It’s like a computer teaching itself the difference between pizza, burgers, and tacos.

Machine Learning (ML) needs human guidance where we define the features, label the data, and help the model learn step-by-step. Deep Learning (DL), on the other hand, teaches itself by processing large amounts of raw, unstructured data through deep neural networks, identifying patterns and features without much human help. Both ML and DL are powerful tools within the broader field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), aiming to make machines smarter and more capable. And yes, whether it’s a simple rule-based model or a complex neural net that they both definitely love pizza as much as we do!
