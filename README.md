#  CrewAI Blog Post Generator from YouTube Transcript

This project automates the creation of blog posts from YouTube videos using a multi-agent system built with **CrewAI**. Itâ€™s designed for content creators, educators, and businesses who want to transform video content into well-structured written articles â€” with minimal manual effort.

---

##  Why CrewAI?

Unlike other frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI enables seamless **agent-to-agent collaboration**. Each agent is assigned a specific role and can communicate and delegate tasks, allowing complex workflows to be handled in a modular, scalable way.

---

##  Use Case

You're managing a YouTube channel with hundreds (or thousands) of videos â€” say tutorials on AI, ML, or data science. You want to convert these into blog posts. Doing this manually is tedious and time-consuming.

### Automated Workflow:

1. A topic is entered.
2. A **Researcher Agent** finds the most relevant YouTube video.
3. A transcript is extracted from the video.
4. A **Writer Agent** takes the content and produces a structured, readable blog post.

##  System Architecture

###  Agents

- **Blog Researcher Agent**
  - Role: Find relevant video for the given topic
  - Tool: YouTubeChannelSearchTool
  - Output: Extracted transcript and key summaries

- **Blog Writer Agent**
  - Role: Write an engaging blog post using the researcher's output
  - Behavior: Converts summaries into structured articles

### ðŸ›  Tasks

- **Research Task**: 
  - Extract transcript and generate a three-paragraph summary
  - Use `yt_tool` to search the channel
- **Writing Task**: 
  - Convert summary into a polished blog post
  - Output saved to `new-blog-post.md`
  - Runs only after researcher task completes

###  Tools

- `YoutubeChannelSearchTool` from `crewai_tools`
- Target channel: `@SimplilearnOfficial`
